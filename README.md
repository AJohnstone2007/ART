# ART
The Ambiguity Retained Translation (ART)

This is the Royal Holloway software language engineering tool ART written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott; we are the authors of the GLL, RNGLR and BRNGLR algorithms.

Our goals are (a) to provide a 'programmer friendly' route into GLL (b) to provide a baseline for principled performance testing of GLL implementations and (c) extend the approach to other general parsing algorithms.
