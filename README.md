# ART
The Ambiguity Retained Translation (ART)

This is the Royal Holloway software language engineering tool ART written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott; we are the authors of the GLL, RNGLR and BRNGLR algorithms.

ART processes language inputs using MGLL Parsing coupled to a general lexer. Semantics may be implemented via either SOS-style reduction rules or attribute-action rules.
