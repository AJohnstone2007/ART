# Ambiguity Retained Translation (ART)

ART is the Royal Holloway software language engineering tool written by Adrian Johnstone and tested by Elizabeth Scott; we are the authors of the GLL, MGLL, RNGLR and BRNGLR algorithms.

The default ART pipeline processes language inputs using an MGLL multiparser coupled to a general lexer, with semantics specified using either SOS-style reduction rules or attribute-action rules. The core idea in ART is to delay ambiguity resolution until a natural point in the pipeline by allowing alternative interpretations to coexist.

You will find a tutorial and reference guide to ART in the document [SoftwareLanguageEngineeringWithART.pdf](https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART/tree/main/doc/SoftwareLanguageEngineeringWithART.pdf).

To use ART, all you need a Java installation and a copy of art.jar which is the current stable version. artALPHA.jar is the current development version which should be treated with caution. 

If you wish to use the Integrated Development Environment you will need a copy of richtextfx.jar, and an operating-system specific JavaFX installation which you can download from https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/.

A variety of alternative algorithms are available in ART; in particular 'reference' GLL implementations that illustrate the central ideas along with a variety of optimisations. An early publication on these versions, and the associated presentation slides are [here](https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART/tree/main/doc/referenceImplementations). The corresponding code is [here](https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART/tree/main/src/uk/ac/rhul/cs/csle/art/cfg/gll).

To characterise the space and time performance of our algorithms, we use a variety of language grammars and language examples which you can find at https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/referenceLanguageCorpora.

You can access our research papers at https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/adrian-johnstone/publications.

Many of those papers include data generated by earlier tools, or earlier versions of ART which may be found in the [old](https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART/tree/main/old) directory.
