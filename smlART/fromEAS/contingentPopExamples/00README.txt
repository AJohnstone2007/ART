Here is a small grammar,
testRecog3.art 
that is required to make a contingent pop when the input index is 1.

The string db is rejected by a GLL recogniser.

If I make a similar example where no cotingent pop is used,
testRecog5.art,
or even where the contingent pop is at index 0,
testRecog4.art,
things seem to work OK.
