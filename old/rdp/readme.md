## RDP V1.7

This is the devlopment directory for RDP V1.7ALPHA which is a late version that may not be a stable. RDP 1.7 has never been formally reused, but it has been used successfully to build the examples here and is used to build the front ends for GTB and ART V2. 

The distributed older versions from V1.0 to V1.6 may be found in subdirectory release_versions

RDP produces graph outputs in VCG (Visualisation of Compiler Graphs) format. VCG was written by Georg Sander as part of the Esprit project COMPARE in the 1990s. As of June 2024, the original web page is still available at https://www.rw.cdl.uni-saarland.de/people/sander/private/html/gsvcg1.html. Many years ago Georg gave permission for the Windows VCG binaries to be distributed with RDP which now reside in subdirectory VCG.
