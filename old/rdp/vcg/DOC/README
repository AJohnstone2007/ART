This directory contains the documentation of the VCG tool.

	visual.ps         - the User documentation


INSTALLATION HINTS
------------------
	1) There is nothing to install. Thus, the Makefile is a dummy
	that makes nothing.  You can print the *.ps files
	on a PostScript printer, and read the other ASCII files. 

	2) We have included the PostScript version of the documentation.
	A LaTeX version does exist, too, but is not included, in order 
	to keep the package small.
	If you need the LaTeX version of the documentation, please
	contact  sander@cs.uni-sb.de
