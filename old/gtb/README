This is the distribution for GTB V2.5 dated 1 November 2005, 
updated by Adrian in June 2013

1. To build under Linux, Cygwin on Windows or other systems with the
GNU g++ compiler: go down into bin and run the build script. It's a
simple one line compilation - if all else fails cut and paste it to
your console winde.

2. Known problems

GTB assumes that pointers and integers are the same size. On some
64-bit architectures (DEC/Compaq Alpha) this assumption is not
valid. g++ will issue warnings in such cases.

3. Using GTB

Once built, we suggest that you start working through the tutorial
manual gtb_tut.ps which makes use of gtb scripts in directories tut_ex
and lib_ex.

4. Source code

The source code lives in two directories: src/gtb_lib contains the
library which is common to GTB and some of the other tools developed
here, and src/gtb contains the modules which are specific to
GTB. Together they make just over 22,000 lines of code: happy reading!
