// When the words "one of " follow the colon in a grammar definition, they sig-
// nify that each of the terminal symbols on the following line or lines is an alterna- tive definition. For example, the lexical grammar for Java contains the production:

ZeroToThree ::=
  '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' ;

// which is merely a convenient abbreviation for:

ZeroToThree ::=
  '0' |
  '1' |
  '2' |
  '3' ;
